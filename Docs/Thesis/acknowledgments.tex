\section*{Acknowledgments}
First of all, I would like to thank Arie Middelkoop for supervising my work. I am thankful for all his help during those times I was stuck with either \rcore or the type system, and for promptly responding to my emails, even at 2am.

Thanks to Atze Dijkstra for helping with the comments and feedback when writing the thesis.

I also want to thank Doaitse Swiersta for suggesting the project and Jeroen Fokker for reminding me that I should start on my thesis project.

Finally I would like to thank my family and friends for supporting me throughout my University career.
