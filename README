The Utrecht Haskell Compiler (UHC)
==================================

When installing from this (https://github.com/UU-ComputerScience/uhc)
repo also use the repo for uhc-util
(https://github.com/UU-ComputerScience/uhc-util) as these are kept in
sync. For further installation instructions see EHC/README in the
subdirectory EHC holding the actual compiler.

Alternatively, and with less features, a lightweight variant of UHC is
available on hackage: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/uhc-light. Its
version lags behind the master of this repo.
